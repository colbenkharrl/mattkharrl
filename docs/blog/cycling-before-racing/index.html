    <p>Bikes have been part of my life in some capacity for most of my life. Walmart bikes as a kid, street BMX bikes as a teenager, fixed-gear bikes in college, and road bikes as a young adult. This relationship was casual and adventurous, focusing more on getting lost with a camera and less on training zones.</p>
<p>After moving from San Franciso to Phoenix, my morning rides went from &ldquo;climbing coastal mountains and crossing the golden gate bridge&rdquo; to &ldquo;riding from flat suburbs to flat farmland.&rdquo; My motivation to ride my bike was suffering, so I started putting more value into other aspects of my rides: average speed, distance, personal records, etc. This marked the start of my cycling mentality shifting to performance and athleticism.</p>
<p>In December 2020, I completed Rapha&rsquo;s &ldquo;Festive 500&rdquo; challenge for the first time: 500km within 8 days. Coming off of that challenge, I realized that my base fitness and training tolerance were solid, and I wanted more. So, I purchased a smart trainer and started my training and performance journey.</p>
<p>I spent 2021 learning about training and performance by and for myself. Training with power, structure, and goals changed how I thought about cycling and myself as an athlete. Zwift opened new doors for me, and occasional group rides exposed me to social discipline and etiquette within the sport. Over 2021 I would see my FTP climb from 3.2w/kg -&gt; 4.1w/kg, and my annual miles would triple to 5000.</p>
<p>The idea of &ldquo;bike racing&rdquo; was always alluring, but I had never spent enough thought or effort to understand what that entails, let alone how I might join the scene. In reality, I was insecure and afraid that this &ldquo;competitive athlete&rdquo; persona I had crafted in my head might be shattered if I went up against &ldquo;real&rdquo; athletes.</p>
<p>I maintained a <em>&ldquo;one day, I will race&rdquo;</em> attitude until March 2022. I jumped on the short-notice opportunity to spend a weekday riding with two well-known bike racers, cycling personalities, and personal heroes of mine. They told me on the ride a few things I hadn&rsquo;t realized I needed to hear:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;you are strong&rdquo; (who doesn&rsquo;t love validation)</li>
<li>&ldquo;find your next local USAC race, sign up in CAT 5, and just do it&rdquo; (pretty simple instructions to follow)</li>
<li>&ldquo;it will be hard, you will fail, that&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; (expect to be humbled)</li>
</ul>
<p>These few brief comments were significant. That night, I signed up for my first USAC race - a CAT 5 criterium - with only three days until the event.</p>
<p>How that race went, as well as the rest of my racing journey, are topics for future blogs.</p>
<p>Sometimes I harbor negative thoughts like &ldquo;if only I had started in high school&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late for me now.&rdquo; However, looking back now, the journey that brought me to my first starting line was exactly what I needed it to be: personal, adventurous, challenging, and humbling.</p>
