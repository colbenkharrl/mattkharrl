Tour de Mesa in 2022 was a 42-mile mass-start road race event involving over 1,000 riders. It featured two laps through the east Phoenix desert and a fair bit of climbing.

Going into the event, I thought I would just put in a decent effort and focus on PRing the main climb (Usery Pass) on one of the laps. I was lined up in the middle of the massive sea of riders, thinking little about positioning at the time. A group of “platinum” riders had their own section in the front and got to take off five minutes earlier than the rest of us. I didn’t know or think much about that, either.

30 seconds into the event, I realized that I wanted to race. My plan of “just go all-out on the climb” went out the window, and I was on a mission to catch up to the front group. For the following two hours, I would push an average of 240 watts, pass hundreds of riders, and never be passed in the process. I finished in just under two hours and felt great about my effort, narrowly landing within the top 100 finishers.

While I obviously didn’t catch up to the leaders, I figured I must have been close. Picture my shock when I was over ten minutes behind the leaders, and they all seemed to average at least 20 watts less than me. I overheard other groups after the race mentioning how “platinum group is everything.” I realized that day that positioning on the starting line is crucial in mass-start events.

On the bright side, I also realized after-the-fact that platinum designation is something you have to earn. Riders must either:

- finish within a specific time in a previous event from the same hosts (who also produce the famous Tour de Tucson).
- have a valid USAC license in category 1 or 2 (local and continental pros).

My strenuous effort landed me just 90 seconds under the qualifying time, meaning I was now a platinum rider for their future events. See my recap of Tour de Tucson to see how important that ended up being.
