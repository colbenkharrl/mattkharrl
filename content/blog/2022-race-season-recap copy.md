I started racing in March 2022, which I soon learned is already halfway through the spring racing season here in Arizona. I knew little about bike racing (tactical or logistical) and had no idea what my strengths or weaknesses might be. It was messy, and each event taught me some vital lessons.

## Event Calendar

Let’s get right to it, then. Here is an overview of all events I attended in 2022. I’ve added links for the event pages, Strava activities, and results.

| Date         | Race                                                                                                       | Duration                                                   | Type            | Location         | Category    | Result                                                                                   |
