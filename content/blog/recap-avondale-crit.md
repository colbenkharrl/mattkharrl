I started racing in March 2022, which I soon learned is already halfway through the spring racing season here in Arizona. I knew little about bike racing (tactical or logistical) and had no idea what my strengths or weaknesses might be.

My first-ever race was a CAT 5 crit, which I was warned would be chaotic and dangerous. Lucky for me, Avondale Crit was about as beginner-friendly as it gets: a simple, oval-shaped coarse with wide and clean roads set in a closed civic center. You could safely take all the corners without worrying about pedal strikes.
Avondale Crit was a lot of fun, even though I made a few huge mistakes:
- I took off from the gun, laid down the power, and unintentionally established a solo breakaway within the first five minutes. Upon realizing this, I panicked and slowed down to let the pack close my half-lap lead. In retrospect, I feel confident that holding the break would have given me a much better chance of winning.
- I pulled the front for much of the race. This wasn’t a tactic as much as it was ignorance of how much energy I was spending and fear of cornering in the middle of a pack of CAT 5 riders.
- I ended up leading out the pack for the last lap and narrowly lost the final sprint to a few riders who sat in for most of the race. I came in fourth, but at least the riders who passed me took the time to find me after, thank me, and advise me to do less work next time.

Finishing 4/16 in my first USAC race felt… disappointing. I knew I had the legs to win, but my inexperience had cost me a podium. One thing was for sure: I was hooked on racing and signed up for another the following weekend.
