South Mountain Bike Classic was technically classified as a circuit race but it felt pretty similar to a crit with a lap length of about one mile. This course was much more technical than Avondale Crit and featured much more elevation (>100 feet per mile). This was my first time seeing hay bales scattered across corners in anticipation of crashes. CAT 5 raced with the Collegiate C riders from ASU and UofA.

On the first descent of the first lap, one of the ASU riders on my tail took a turn too wide and ended up over his handlebars and into a large boulder at >20mph. It was the worst bike crash I had ever seen, and he eventually had to be taken off and treated by emergency medical services. To my surprise, the race kept going without even a pause. This meant that each lap included a brief status update on the bloodied kid. He was not having a good time.

Within a few laps, a break of three CAT 5 riders formed, and we were set to carry and increase our lead until the end. That is until the second-to-last lap when I shifted at the top of the climb and dropped my chain. The two other riders took off, and I had to hop off to sort out a mechanical. It took me a long time to realize that my chain had, in fact, jumped right out of the derailleur hanger (a first for me). It took me about 90 seconds to get back on the bike (during which time two more riders caught up and passed me). I tried to chase back and recover a position or two but ultimately finished 5th overall.

Losing a podium finish (and potentially a win) due to a mechanical was hard to swallow. I hated my bike for a long time after that, as if it had intentionally scorned me out of a victory. I would get over it soon, though, because I had my first road race up next.

**Note:** No matter the result, I left this race a winner because one of the other riders in the breakaway became my training partner and a lifelong friend. I honestly don’t know where my racing calendar would be if I didn’t have him to push me.
